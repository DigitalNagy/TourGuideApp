            "The Arc de Triomphe, built in 1806, is one of the most famous monuments in Paris, standing at the western end of the Champs-Elysees. It was designed in 1806 by the architect Jean Chalgrin to memorialize the triumphal battles of Napoleon Bonaparte, and stands over 51-metre (164 ft) in height and is 45-metre (148 ft) wide. The monument is the second largest triumphal arch in existence, and its design was originally inspired by the Roman Arch of Titus. It displays heroically nude French youths against bearded Germanic warriors in chain mail, which set the tone for public monuments with triumphant nationalistic messages, right up until World War I. Beneath the arch is a tomb where President John F Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy, of the United States of America, were accompanied by French President Charles de Gaulle when they paid their respects in 1961, known as the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier."|

            "Notre-Dame de Paris, also known as Notre-Dame Cathedral or simply Notre-Dame, is a medieval Catholic cathedral in the fourth district of Paris, France. The cathedral is widely considered to be one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture, and it is among the largest and most well-known church buildings in the world. The naturalism of its sculptures and stained glass are in contrast with earlier Romanesque architecture. As the cathedral of the Archdiocese of Paris, Notre-Dame contains the cathedra of the Archbishop of Paris. The cathedral treasury contains a reliquary, which houses some of Catholicism\'s most important relics, including the purported Crown of Thorns, a fragment of the True Cross, and one of the Holy Nails. In the 1790s, Notre-Dame suffered desecration in the radical phase of the French Revolution when much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed. An extensive restoration was done later on. Standing more than 400 feet (120 meters) high with two lofty towers and a spire, the cathedral allows visitors to admire the awe-inspiring rose windows, Gothic carvings, beautiful sculptures and a collection of relics."|

            "The Place de la Concorde is one of the major public squares in Paris, France. Measuring 8.64 hectares in area, it is the largest square in the French capital. It is located in the city\'s eighth district, at the eastern end of the Champs-Elysees. The place was designed by Ange-Jacques Gabriel in 1755.Decorated with statues and fountains, the area was named Place Louis XV to honor the king at that time. During the French Revolution in 1789 the statue of Louis XV of France was torn down and the area renamed Place de la Revolution. It was in this square that the French King Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and many others were guillotined during the French revolution. In 1795, the square was renamed Place de la Concorde as a gesture of reconciliation after the turmoil of the French Revolution. The large 3200 years old Egyptian obelisk in the center of the Place de la Concorde was brought from the Temple of Luxor in the 19th century. The obelisk is decorated with hieroglyphics exalting the reign of the pharaoh Ramesses II. The obelisk is flanked on both sides by fountains constructed at the time of its erection on the Place."|

            "The Palace of Versailles, Chateau de Versailles, or simply Versailles, is a royal chateau in Versailles in the Ile-de-France region of France. When the château was built, Versailles was a small village dating from the 11th century; today, however, it is a wealthy suburb of Paris, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) southwest of the centre of the French capital. Versailles was the seat of political power in the Kingdom of France from 1682, when King Louis XIV moved the royal court from Paris, until the royal family was forced to return to the capital in October 1789, within three months after the beginning of the French Revolution. The Palace of Versailles started out life as a royal hunting lodge, but later became a palace housing the king\'s court. The mammoth structure is ornate, opulent and over the top in its richness. It is one of Paris\'s most visited landmarks, with visitors coming to see its magnificent gardens and the Hall of Mirrors with its 357 mirrors decorating 17 arches. The Palace of Versailles ceased being a royal residence during the French Revolution and today houses a museum of French history. Versailles is therefore famous not only as a building, but as a symbol of the system of absolute monarchy of the Ancien Regime and is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site."|

            "The Empire State Building is a 102-story skyscraper located on Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets in Midtown, Manhattan, New York City. Taking a mere 11 months to construct, the 1454-foot-tall emblem became the city\'s highest building upon completion in 1931. It\'s name is derived from the nickname for New York, the Empire State. The Empire State Building is currently the fifth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States and the 34th-tallest in the world. The Empire State Building is an American cultural icon. It is designed in the distinctive Art Deco style and has been named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1986. A terrace on the 103rd level of this building was once intended for use as a docking station for airships and the topper\'s three tiers of lights can illuminate up to nine colors at a time. In 1945, 14 tenants were killed when a plane crashed into the 79th floor during heavy fog. This iconic landmark has been featured in many Hollywood movies to date including \'King Kong\', \'Sleepless in Seattle\', and \'Superman II\'."|

It was designed by John Augustus Roebling, a Germany-born industrial engineer. Completed in 1883, it connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn by spanning the East River. It has a main span of 1,595.5 feet (486.3 m) and was the first steel-wire suspension bridge constructed. The architectural style is neo-Gothic and the paint scheme of the bridge is \'Brooklyn Bridge Tan\' and \'Silver\'. Since opening, it has become an icon of New York City and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1972. Since the 1980s, it has been floodlit at night to highlight its architectural features. The bridge attracts thousands of tourists and locals, who enjoy spectacular views of lower Manhattan and other city landmarks (such as the Statue of Liberty and Governors Island) as they stroll its more-than-mile-long expanse. The bridge is often featured in wide shots of the New York City skyline in a number of television dramas and films including \'Annie Hall\', \'Gangs of New York\', \'Independence Day\', \'Once Upon a Time in America\', \'The Avengers\', and \'Godzilla\'."|

            "Central Park is an urban park in Manhattan, New York City. Central Park is the most visited urban park in the United States, with 40 million visitors in 2013, and one of the most filmed locations in the world. The park was established in 1857 on 778 acres of land. When the terrain for Central Park was bought by the City of New York in 1853, it was faraway from civilization, somewhere between the City of New York and the village Harlem. The area contained sheds from colonists, quarries, pig farms and swamps. In 1857, the city of New York organized a competition for the design of this new park, which had to rival with the great parks in London and Paris. A design by Frederic Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, named \'the Greensward Plan\' was chosen. This plan featured an English style landscape with large meadows, several lakes and hills, winding pedestrian roads, and huge number of trees that can hide the tall buildings, with a goal to create a place where people could relax and meditate. Central Park was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962, and was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage sites in April 2017. The park boasts several lakes, theaters, ice rinks, fountains, tennis courts, baseball fields, many playgrounds and other facilities. It is also home to the Central Park Zoo and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Especially during the weekends, when cars are not allowed into the park, Central Park is a welcome oasis in this hectic city. Today, the 843-acre plot draws millions of visitors to its skyscraper-bordered vistas in all seasons: sunbathers and picnickers in summer, ice-skaters in winter, and bird-watchers in spring and fall."|

            "The Statue of Liberty is a colossal neoclassical sculpture on Liberty Island in New York Harbor in New York City, in the United States. The island was earlier called Bedloe Island which was renamed Liberty Island. The copper statue, a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States, was designed by French sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel. The statue is about 151 feet tall, from the base to the tip of the torch (305 feet with the pedestal and foundation). The total weight of the Statue of Liberty is 450,000 pounds. The color of the statue is green because a mold of copper was heated and pressed over a frame and hammered by hand. This hammering, called repousse in French, made the Statue of Liberty strong yet light in weight. Copper turns a green with age and exposure to the elements. The statue was dedicated on October 28, 1886. The Statue of Liberty is a robed female figure representing Libertas, the Roman goddess. She holds a torch above her head, and in her left arm carries a tabula ansata inscribed in Roman numerals with \'JULY IV MDCCLXXVI\' (July 4, 1776), the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. A broken chain lies at her feet. The statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States, and was a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad. A climb to the crown affords a panoramic view of New York Harbor and the chance to see the literal nuts and bolts of Bartholdi\'s creation. In 1984, the Statue of Liberty was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site."|

            "Zuma in London\'s knightsbridge offers something completely new - a sophisticated twist on the traditional japanese izakaya style of informal eating and drinking. The ethos behind Zuma is to deliver an authentic flavour of the east while respecting the traditions of the past. Out of simplicity can come excellence, and the food at Zuma is a case in point. The venue may be swish (with well-to-do patrons propping up the amply stocked cedar bar), the fixtures and fittings expensive, but when it comes to the food, much of the wow factor is down to high-class ingredients that haven\'t been messed around with too much."|

            "The original All\'Oro was a tiny but very buzzy gourmet restaurant in the Parioli district. At the beginning of 2013, chef Riccardo di Giacinto relocated to the First Luxury Art Hotel, not far from Piazza del Popolo, where his inventive and sometimes playful tweaks of the Roman tradition have more room to stretch and strut. He\'s a master of culinary camouflage - one of his signature dishes is coda alla vaccinara (oxtail) dressed up to look like a Ferrero Rocher bonbon. Sommelier Stefano Magistri is an able guide to some of Italy\'s lesser-known quality producers, and the four-course and six-course tasting menus allow you to chart your own course through the menu at substantial savings on à la carte prices. In summer, the elegant but viewless main restaurant is joined by a ravishing rooftop space, called 0° 300° in reference to its two culinary strands - raw platters, and fish or meat roasted (at 300 degrees) in a wood-fired oven."|

It\'s been going for almost 20 years now, but this relaxed, contemporary Italian restaurant on the Gianicolo hill above Trastevere continues to deliver. The interior is warmly minimalist; the very few outside tables – a novelty in the recently pedestrianised piazza - should be booked well ahead. Risotto with Castelmagno cheese in Nebbiolo sauce is an Antico Arco classic; meat, fish and game share the credits, and there are even a few veggie dishes."|

He has kept it exactly the same - the sequence of little rooms, the age-old French dishes that have become surprisingly hard to find - but made it much better. Try starters like tender green bean salad or snails, then garlicky frogs\' legs, buttery sole meuniere or Allard\'s classic duck with olives served for two, and a rum savarin with whipped cream to finish. Service blends friendliness and professionalism, and Ducasse protegee Laetitia Rouabah continues the Allard tradition of female chefs (begun by Marthe Allard back in 1932).
